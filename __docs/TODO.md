✅

- Reset Expo project ✅
- src folder ✅
- Add Native Wind ✅
- Add Redux ✅
- Add AsyncStorage ✅
- Implement the UI ✅
- Think about the plan ✅

- We can't use Async Storage inside server, because AsyncStorage gets the values on client side, while Server is on server side
- So, the server is stateless, how can we add state to it?

- Add Redux API
- Create 3 endpoints:
  - One: CronJob
  - Two: Getting the data
  - Three: Updating the target temperature
